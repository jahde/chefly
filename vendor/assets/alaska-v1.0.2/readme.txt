==========================

** Where's my theme? **

In this folder! Your theme files are located in the folder named ‘theme’.


** How do I use the theme? **

It's easy! Simply upload the contents of the ‘theme’ folder to your server and start editing the
files as you desire. Best to use a good text-editor to make changes, such as Sublime Text 2, found at http://sublimetext.com/2.


** Is there any further documentation? **

Yes! Simply go to the ‘user-guides’ folder and double-click the user-guide.pdf file and open with a PDF compatible reader/viewer. From there, you can read the full documentation & guidelines.


** I need help, is there any support available? *

Of course! We're available to help you out from Monday-Friday, 9-5pm, GMT+0, (London time). Simply go back to the marketplace where you purchased the theme, and leave us a comment on the theme page. We will get back to you in due course.

Alternatively, you can send us an email to help@themescollective.com for private inquiries.
